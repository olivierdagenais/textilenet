# textilenet

This library is a .NET implementation of Textile, which also features a dual-pane Textile editor with semi-live preview.

> Textile is a simple text markup. Simple symbols mark words' emphasis.
> Blocks of text can be easily tagged as headers, quotes, or lists.
> A Textile document can then be converted to HTML for viewing on the web.
